# Mixed-model-Expectancy-Nancy-copy-paste


Task:
I want 4 line-charts in APA7 format. Right now these line-charts are in the form of jamovi outputs from my analysis (indicated as Figure 1- 4 below) that I want to reproduce in APA7 format. I have attached instructions under each figure as well as their simple effects & EMMS tables to reproduce these charts.
For Figures 1-4: Produce all figures in the same style, format, same axis ie for the X-axis use the same time point of 0,4,8,12 months














Figure 1
Effect of Outcome Expectancy on BAI Scores at Post-Treatment and Follow-Up
 
Instructions for APA7 formatting 
Format Figure 1 & 2 to be the same as the following reference plot (from the parent study)









Figure 1 
1.	Use Figure title as provided 
2.	EMMS data provided in file “Mixed Model BAI Expectancy”
3.	Use SE bars (please make them look small and not clutter the plot)
4.	Prefer to have horizontal gridlines (as per reference plot) but not essential
5.	Insert a vertical dotted gridline at 4-month (as per reference plot to signify post-treatment)
6.	Change the legend to:
	Outcome expectancy levels
Low 
Average 
High 
7.	Have the 3 levels of Expectancy in different colours or patterns
8.	Change Y-axis to same as the reference plot (do not use T0 to T3):
Time (months)
0
4
8
12
9.	Change X-axis to same as the reference plot:
Estimated BAI (95% CI)












Figure 2
Effect of Treatment Credibility on BAI Scores at Post-Treatment and Follow-Up
 
Instructions for APA7 formatting 













Figure 2
1.	Use Figure title as provided 
2.	EMMS data provided in file “Mixed Model BAI Credibility”
3.	Use SE bars (please make them look small and not clutter the plot)

Figure 3
1.	Use Figure title as provided

Outcome expectancy levels
Low 
Average

7.	Have the 3 levels of Expectancy in different colours or patterns
8.	Change Y-axis to same as the reference plot (do not use T0 to T3). Please note that CSR didn’t collect any data for 8 months follow-up so visually show as per the reference plot (with no mark & SE bars at 8-months)
Time (months)
